# Linux-kernel-scheduling-techniques
Discuss, in a very clear manner, what scheduling techniques does Linux kernel use?

Linux is an open-source operating system used in various devices, such as servers, smartphones, and embedded systems.

The Linux kernel manages tasks and resources of the system, including the scheduling of tasks to be executed by the processor.
The Linux kernel scheduler is responsible for deciding which task to run on the processor at any given time.

Different scheduling techniques are used by the Linux kernel scheduler to efficiently schedule tasks, including round-robin, priority-based, and real-time scheduling.

Understanding the different Linux kernel scheduling techniques is crucial for developers and system administrators who want to optimize the performance of their Linux-based systems.
With this in mind, what are the different Linux kernel scheduling techniques, and how do they work?
